### User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data


GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database


WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON


WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database


WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
